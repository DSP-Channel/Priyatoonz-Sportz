NEO 6 Series and onwards can be uses. Other compatible hardware can also
be used for any of above hardware, IoT hardware other than LoRa/BLE
compatible can also be used, but source code compatibility and testing
in not 100% guaranteed.

  

The Priyatoonz-Sportz repository and its derived projects are intended
for Poof-of-Concept (PoC) only-where user can test her program codes,
however new design of customized hardware may be required for most of
commercial
applications.
