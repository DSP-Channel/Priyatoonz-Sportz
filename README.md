NEO 6 Series and onwards can be uses. Other compatible hardware can also
be used for any of above hardware, Other IoT hardware other than LoRa
compatible can also be used, but source code compatibility and testing
in not 100% guaranteed.

\

The Priyatoonz-Sportz project is intended as Poof-of-Concept (PoC)
only-where user can test her codes, design of customized hardware may be
required for any commercial application.
